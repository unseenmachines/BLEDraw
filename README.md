# BLEDraw

This is a simple collaborative drawing app to demonstrate BLE communications between two iOS devices.  

It has only been tested with an iPhone 6 and an iPad Air 2. 

### Usage ###

Simply launch the app on 2 devices in BLE proximity and make sure bluetooth is enabled on each device. 

Draw whatever you like! Play tic tac toe!

Note: This is only intended to be used with 2 devices at a time. It doesn't do anything to make sure of this, so running it on more than 2 will lead to interesting results ;) 

### Setup ###

This project uses CocoaPods, so run `pod install` and open the .xcworkspace file.
